# AppLoader
This Project is my contribution to Tim Corey's #CSharpChallenge 
## What it does?
My project involves a WPF form that is used to run apps at a click of a button. At this point apps can be added and ran all at once or individually and they can be set to run during the startup of your machine.
## Requirements
- This app is designed to only work on windows 10.
- .NET 5.0+
